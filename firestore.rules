/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for UNDB ProfAssist.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for professor-related data,
 * ensuring that professors can only access and modify data associated with their accounts.
 * Students have read access to their own records.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /professors/{professorId}: Stores professor profiles, where professorId MUST match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - /professors/{professorId}/courses/{courseId}: Stores courses owned by a professor.
 * - /professors/{professorId}/courses/{courseId}/classrooms/{classroomId}: Stores classrooms for a specific course.
 * - /students/{studentId}: Stores student profiles, globally accessible for reads, but create/update are limited to admins or the student themselves.
 * - /professors/{professorId}/courses/{courseId}/classrooms/{classroomId}/classroomStudents/{classRoomStudentId} Represents the association between a classroom and a student.
 * - /professors/{professorId}/documents/{documentId}: Stores professor documents.
 * - /professors/{professorId}/courses/{courseId}/academicEvents/{academicEventId}: Stores academic events for courses.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Path-based ownership is enforced for all professor-owned data. The professorId in the path MUST match the authenticated user's UID.
 * - Data consistency is enforced by validating that the professorId stored in the document matches the professorId in the path.
 * - Students can only read their own profiles.
 * - No public data listing is permitted. List operations are restricted to owners for their respective data.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The 'professorId' is denormalized into subcollections (courses, classrooms, documents, academicEvents) to enable
 * fast, independent authorization checks without requiring additional `get()` calls.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * Private data (professor profiles, courses, classrooms, documents, academicEvents) is stored under the /professors/{professorId} path,
 * ensuring that only the professor has access.
